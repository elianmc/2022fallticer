To ensure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technologies. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, meaning if you cut a tree down, the tree will not grow back. Twelve civilizations are available, each with individual sets of attributes, including a varying number of available technologies and units. Each civilization has technologies unique to them, so that no civilization possesses all the technologies possible within the game. A major component of the game is the advancement through four ages. These are the Stone Age (Mesolithic/Paleolithic), Tool Age (Neolithic/Chalcolithic), Bronze Age and Iron Age. Advancement between ages is researched at the Town Center and each advancement brings the player new technologies, weapons, and units.",2000-10-30 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

114099,80034,Aliens Versus Predator: Gold Edition,"The storylines of the three player characters are independent of one another. As an Alien the player must defend the Alien hive from human marines, then stow away on an evacuating spacecraft and reach the marines' ship, the Ferarco. When the Ferarco's self-destruct system is activated, the player must reach the escape shuttle, which takes them to Gateway Station. Here the player explores the station and battles more marines, reaching a ship departing for Earth. Before boarding the ship the player battles two Predators, after which the Alien enters the Earth-bound shuttle.

When playing as the Colonial Marine, the player begins at a research station on LV-426 built to study the derelict spacecraft where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs in the film Alien (1979). Aliens attack and the player must fight their way through the research facility, the derelict ship, and an adjoining colony. Next the player explores the atmosphere processing station and shuts down its cooling valves in order to cause an explosion which will wipe out the Aliens. The player character escapes in a drop ship and travels to Odobenus Station in orbit above the planetoid, where they battle more Aliens, Predators, facehuggers, and cybernetically-enhanced Aliens until reaching the spaceship Tyrargo. Aboard the ship the player battles more enemies including an Alien/Predator hybrid and ""praetorian"" Aliens. The player then battles an Alien queen, defeating it by expelling it through the airlock.

The Predator character's storyline visits three different planets, beginning with the player hunting marines in order to recover a captured Predator ship and its occupant from a human military base. Aliens are accidentally released in the base and the player discovers that the humans have created an Alien/Predator hybrid by implanting the captured Predator with an Alien embryo. The player defeats the hybrid, triggers the facility's self-destruct mechanism, and escapes in the Predator ship. The player next visits Fiorina ""Fury"" 161, the prison planet that is the setting of Alien 3 (1992), where more Aliens and marines are battled. Finally the player visits a marine-controlled Alien habitat, battling cybernetically-enhanced Aliens, ""praetorian"" Aliens, and finally the Alien Queen.",2000-03-28 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

To ensure that the skirmishes and conflicts don't expand, the BS-OSA or Baldr System - Observation Structure Army is set up to police the region.

194239,6,Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn,"Some time after the events described in Baldur's Gate, the protagonist and his friends Imoen, Minsc and Jaheira have been captured by an elven mage called Jon Irenicus. His intentions and connection to the heroes unknown, Irenicus conducts experiments on them, holding them in cages somewhere in his vast underground complex. During his absence, the heroes manage to escape, and soon find themselves in the city of Athkatla in the country of Amn, where they confront Irenicus. However, at that moment several wizards arrive and arrest both Irenicus and Imoen for unlicensed use of magic. The first task at hand is to raise the money needed to rescue Imoen, before facing Irenicus again and unraveling his true goals.

Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a party-based role-playing game using the AD&D rules. The basic gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor: the player navigates a party of up to six active combatants over isometric environments, conversing with non-playable characters using branching dialogue, and fighting enemies in real-time, free-movement combat that can be paused to issue specific orders to the characters. World traveling now occurs by selecting locations on a map rather than exploring wilderness areas to reach the destination. However, the game world is larger than in the previous game, with more individual locations to visit and side quests to perform.

Being a direct sequel to Baldur's Gate, the game lets the player control stronger, higher-level characters from the onset. The main character can also be imported from the previous installment. Three new classes (sorcerer, monk, and barbarian) are available along with those that were present in the original game. Characters can also acquire specializations within most of the classes: a paladin, for instance, can become a dragon slayer or an inquisitor. Weapon proficiencies are more specific: for example, instead of just specializing in blades, the player can choose between proficiencies in long swords, two-handed swords, bastard swords, katanas and scimitars. There are many new types of weapons, armor, and magic spells in the sequel.

Sixteen characters may join the party during the course of the story. Each of them has his or her own motivations, sometimes conflicting with those of other characters. Scripted events and interaction with playable as well as non-playable characters have been noticeably increased in the sequel. The main character can also romance some of the companions by choosing appropriate behavior and dialogue lines. The game allows the player to make many moral decisions and pursue character-specific side quests unrelated to the main story. Many of the companions bring their own quests, and unique tasks are available for the main character depending on his or her class.",2000-09-21 00:00:00.000,155,NULL,90.0000,1,88.9708,391

73020,140838,Breakout,"The Breakout world of 2000 is an island filled with bizarre creatures in the form of paddles and balls. Bouncer enjoys his life their with Daisy, his beautiful girlfriend. All was fine in paradise until one day when Bouncer took a swim out to sea to rescue a ball. While Bouncer was gone, the evil Batnix and his henchmen kidnapped Daisy. 
 
 
When Bouncer returned, he was imprisoned in a dark and dank jail cell. To prevent Bouncer's friends from busting him out of prison, Batnix put them in jails all across the world. Bouncer attempted to escape on his own, but he was caught and affixed to a ball and chain. Luckily, the ball was friendly and let Bouncer smack him against the wall, shattering the bricks and mortar, freeing both ball and paddle from prison. Now, Bouncer must rescue all his friends. 
 
 
The paddle you control in Breakout can be angled or curved so that you can aim the ball more precisely and hit objects that aren't directly in front of you. As you progress through the game, you can add paddle friends (each with a unique skill) to your arsenal and call on them at any time to take Bouncer's place. Also, there are many power-ups to collect, such as Extra Life, Big Paddle, and Grab Ball, which lets you catch the ball and reposition it prior to shooting it at an object. 
 
 
Most of the levels in Breakout require you to hit the ball in order to knock down and demolish obstructions. However, some of the levels are less simplistic, requiring you to perform such tasks as knock down targets in a specific order. In a few of the levels, Bouncer must get up on two feet and do things most paddles have never dreamed of (you'll have to play the game to find out what). 
 
 
After you complete a level, you will be ranked according to performance. The higher your ranking, the harder the challenge. To improve your ranking, you can repeat earlier levels.",2000-09-23 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Zero is one of these men. He is a commander of the independent Fleet, what remains of the armed forces of Earth. The war against humanoids left him without family and now his only motivation is to fight the mechanical men, but he receives an order from the supreme commander: to hunt a space pirate called Captain Harlock, who is said to be allied with the mechanical men.

Zero faces a difficult situation, as Harlock was the one who trained him and he only assaults the ships of the mechanical men. Determined to find the truth, Zero accepts the mission.

After having his wife and child disappear in the battle between the humans and Machine men, Zero has no choice but to serve Earth's government as Captain of second rate ships. After picking up a SOS signal, Zero soon meets Harlock who blows up several cargo ship and destroys Zero's own. After coming back to Earth, Zero is given a new task of hunting down the space pirate Harlock with his new crew of machine men and humans in his old ship, the Karyu.

Zero is often faced with problems between the machine men and the humans on his ship who always seem to fight, often causing problems. After meeting Harlock, Zero has more of an appreciation towards him and stills believes in him even after he sees him attack civilians. Later on in the series, Zero and his first officer Marina Oki grow feelings for each other and end up falling in love.",2000-05-18 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

179335,4137,Covert Ops : Nuclear Dawn,"The player controls Lieutenant Jack Morton of NATO, the sole survivor of a terrorist strike on the Blue Harvest, an armored train. He is aided by Christina Wayborn throughout the game, the French ambassador's bodyguard and the NATO council. Traveling around the various carriages of the train, the player must defeat the terrorists, find the French ambassador, and prevent the terrorists from using a nuclear weapon.

The terrorists, under the leadership of Boris Zugoski, detonate some C4 charges in parts of the train, kill all those who resist and take the French ambassador's family hostage. At a certain point in the game Boris is killed by Jack and it appears that the ambassador's assistant, Phillip Mason, is actually a double agent sent to steal a data disk from the Blue Harvest.

The ending depends upon what data disk the player gave Mason.

Good endings consist of Mason attempting to escape in the helicopter but being stopped by Jack who stops the nuclear bombs on board. The Ambassador is saved as is Billy.

Bad endings consist of Mason escaping and remaining at large. Jack then stops the nuclear bombs however the Ambassador dies as does Billy.",2000-01-27 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,69.9515,6

176755,15863,Crimson Skies,"In 1937, Nathan Zachary and the Fortune Hunters were recovering from the foul betrayal of Lucas Miles in the skies over Cuba by hunting for the lost treasure of Sir Francis Drake. Locating Drake's Gold, the Fortune Hunters find evidence of British interest in Hawaii, and are set upon by the Medusas. While victorious, the Fortune Hunters are curious as to the reason for the British presence. Seizing a British Balmoral leads them to a secret British base, which they promptly destroy. Fighting off a counterattacks from HMS Barracuda, the Fortune Hunters are able to make repairs to the Pandora using the British facilities and recovered Drake's Gold, despite last-minute interference from the Royal Air Force. 
 
Rejoicing in their newfound wealth, the Fortune Hunters cancel their party when they receive a distress call from an old friend - Ilsa Fassenbiender, daughter of Doctor Wilhelm Fassenbiender, radios the Fortune Hunters with news that her father has been kidnapped by the Soviet secret police, while she herself is kept prisoner by Boeing Aviation in Pacifica. The Fortune Hunters launched an assault on the CCCP zeppelin Workers' Voyage to retrieve the doctor, which resulted in Nathan Zachary once again encountering his old flame, the Black Swan. Successful in their flying rescue, the Fortune Hunters attempt to repeat their success with a lightning raid on the Boeing plant, hoping to both rescue Ilsa and steal the prototype Hughes Bloodhawk, Blue Streak. Again successful, the Fortune Hunters are forced to strike agains the USSR once again - this time attacking a petrol tanker off the coast of Pacifica to refuel the Pandora. Returning to Pacifica, the Fortune Hunters attack a zeppelin belonging to Blake Aviation Security in a pre-emptive strike which is an unmigitigated success. 
 
Shortly after this victory, the Fortune Hunters found themselves battling a new enemy. The previously unknown pirate gang, the Black Hats, had shot down the Workers' Voyage, an act that might not have been possible had the Fortune Hunters not destroyed its escorts. Consumed with guilt, the Fortune Hunters descended upon the wreckage, driving off the Black Hats and ensuring the survival of the hospital ship sent in to rescue survivors. 
 
Flush with victory and with two of the most brilliant aircraft designers in the world in tow, the Fortune Hunters head south, for the Nation of Hollywood. Although their original intention was merely to rescue a movie starlet trapped by her contract, the Fortune Hunters followed another successful rescue with the theft of the world's largest airplane and participating in the first Johnson Cup Race, which Nathan Zachary won by a considerable margin. This victory, on Johnny Johnson's home turf, drove him to attempt a nefarious plan to destroy Zachary. When that failed, he used the delay caused by the race to send a Hughes Aviation combat zeppelin to destroy the Fortune Hunters' Pandora. While the assault resulted in the destruction of the Hughes Aviation zeppelin, the Pandora was badly damaged. Fleeing inland, the Fortune Hunters were forced to hijack the cargo zeppelin Figaro to provide the Pandora with a tow. 
 
Arriving in Sky Haven, the Fortune Hunters encountered Black Swan and her group. With both sides willing to let bygones be bygones, the party went late into the night. 
 
The next morning, however, Zachary awoke to find his crew missing, and his only ally the Black Swan, whose crew had also mysteriously disappeared. Hunting the area around Sky Haven, Zachary picked up a transmission from Sparks, the Pandora's pilot. He was aboard the Rocky Express. Zachary hastened to rescue his pilot, but the Express was attacked by Black Hats. The Express was escorted by Hellhounds from Sacred Trust Incorporated... who were expecting the Black Hats. Zachary and the Black Swan drove off both the pirates and the supposed security, disabled the Express' defences, and scooped up Sparks seconds before the Express' locomotive exploded. 
 
Convinced the Black Hats are responsible for the disappearance of their crews, Zachary and the Black Swan determine to hunt down a member of the Black Hats leadership... Ulysses Boothe. Finding Boothe, Zachary was able to shoot him down and capture him, and proposed to trade him back to the Hats in exchange for the return of the crews. Furious, but without options, Boothe agreed. Zachary dropped Boothe at the agreed-upon location, only to be told that the crews were being held inside a cargo zeppelin which had been wired with explosives. With consummate skill, Zachary was able to shoot free the zeppelin, board it, and release the crews. While the crews escaped, Black Swan herself was shot down and captured on the ground. 
 
Together, the Fortune Hunters and the Black Swans proceeded to decimate the Black Hats' operations in Sky Haven, culminating in the utter destruction of their mountaintop base, the theft of dozens of aerial torpedoes and the rescue of the Black Swan. 
 
Realising there had to be a secret alliance between the Black Hats and Sacred Trust, Zachary was forced to approach the one man who might be able to help them... Paladin Blake. While initially distrustful, Zachary was able to convince Blake of his sincerity and recruit him to assist the Fortune Hunters in their efforts to exterminate both the Black Hats and Sacred Trust. 
 
Heading for the Sacred Trust HQ in Manhattan, Zachary contacted an old friend of his, who lead him to an Sacred Trust warehouse crammed with illegal merchandise, which was being loaded onto a German freighter. Destroying the warehouse and the freighter, Zachary was able to draw official attention to the activities of Sacred Trust. 
 
However, the Fortune Hunters needed more evidence. Evidence such as that known by Waldo Carney, Sacred Trust's accountant, who was trying to flee the city. When his zeppelin was attacked by Black Hats, the Fortune Hunters were able to rescue him and transport him safely to police HQ. 
 
Convinced their secrets had been revealed, Sacred Trust attempted to flee the city, loading their remaining contraband and documents onto zeppelins. However, the Fortune Hunts and Blake Aviation Security were able to disable their zeppelins, as well as the stolen Spruce Goose, and prevent Sacred Trust from removing the vital evidence. 
 
Furious at these repeated defeats, the true master behind both the Black Hats and Sacred Trust revealed himself - Lucas Miles, the man who had betrayed the Fortune Hunters in Cuba. In his mighty zeppelin Dante, Miles attempted to flee, but his zeppelin and his fighters were no match for the combined force of the Fortune Hunters and Blake Aviation Security. The Dante was shot down, and Miles was killed. 
 
Victorious once again, the Fortune Hunters accepted a substantial reward from the government of the Empire State, and decided to take a tropical break to spend it. Sea Haven is always nice this time of the year...",2000-09-17 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,80.0000,1,75.2981,16

Rool, who had commanded his Kremling minions to steal the bananas. Two ropes drop from above and suddenly two Kritters appear.

As Diddy is not strong enough to defeat Krusha by himself, he is overpowered and defeated by the Kremling. The lizars seal Diddy inside a barrel and then throw it in the bushes.
Donkey's grandfather, Cranky Kong, rushes inside the treehouse to tell Donkey Kong to wake up so he may tell him what happened. He then tells Donkey to check his Banana Cave.

185193,8600,Fear Effect,"Set around the year 2050. When Wee Ming, the daughter of a powerful Hong Kong Triad boss disappears, a trio of mercenaries search for her in the city. They have not been hired to find her, but they intend to kidnap the girl before her father's men locate her and hold her for ransom. Wee Ming has vanished into the fictional Shan Xi protectorate; Hana Tsu-Vachel, the lead character and femme fatale of the group, used to work in a brothel somewhere in that region.

Hana arrives in Hong Kong accompanied by her partners, Royce Glas and Jacob ""Deke"" DeCourt. What begins as a simple snatch and grab turns into a fiasco: The father of the runaway, Mr. Lam, attributes his fortune and power to a pact he made with demons long ago. Wee Ming, who is a paper doll given life, has been scheduled to serve as a sacrifice to Yim Lau Wong, the mythical ""King of Hell"". Hana's contact inside Mr. Lam's organization, Jin, is discovered, tortured, and left to die with a bomb strapped to his chest. Hana frees him, but he is killed shortly after. Meanwhile, Glas is attacked by a VTOL jet and forced to flee into Mr. Lam's building. After avenging Jin, Hana is captured and beaten by Mr. Lam and his thugs. Glas is able to rescue Hana, and the duo make their escape where they meet Deke in front of the hotel they are staying at. While listening to Jin's last message for Hana, the trio are forced off a bridge but are able to swim to a junk. While sailing down a river, Deke spots Wee Ming amongst a burning village. Deke and Glas give chase while Hana gets dressed, but all three are separated by the undead villagers.

They stumble upon a military train where the hostile soldiers shoot anyone on sight for fear of the villagers. Hana and Deke wreck the train trying to steal it, but Glas is able to find a jeep with Wee Ming sitting inside. She asks to be taken to a Madam Chen's restaurant, which doubles as a brothel, hoping to find answers about her existence. When Glas is caught sneaking in the brothel, Mr. Lam surprises him, cutting off his left arm. At the same time, Deke is murdered while trying to infiltrate the brothel from upstairs. Hana sneaks in by dressing up like one of the prostitutes, where she runs into Wee Ming again after she had been dragged off by Madam Chen, who is working for Mr. Lam. Wee Ming's powers activate, after being splashed with Deke's blood, transforming the working girls and Madam Chen's thugs into demons.

The one-armed Glas reawakens in a meat locker, surprised to find he is still alive; he surmises that Mr. Lam must be planning a slow death for him. Wee Ming arrives and tries her best to aid him. When Hana storms in to confront her former boss, Madam Chen, she learns that Chen is actually a demon in disguise. In the ensuing fight, Chen and her minions are killed, but Mr. Lam disappears with his daughter into a portal to Hell. Determined to save Wee Ming from whatever fate Mr. Lam has in store for her, Hana follows them into the portal, with Glas reawakening, and frees himself to give chase.

In a surreal journey through Hell, Hana meets the Black and White Guards of Impermanence who give her cryptic messages about her fate. Glas encounters the reanimated corpse of Deke, who is being tortured for the many murders he has committed. Deke takes on a grotesque demonic form and attacks Glas. After he is victorious, Glas promises to avenge Deke. Meanwhile, Hana confronts Yim Lau Wong, who explains that Hell has become overburdened with the souls of the guilty. Once Wee Ming is returned to the netherworld, Yim Lau Wong will be able to expand the reaches of Hell and consume Earth. Hana was chosen to look after Wee Ming because Yim Lau Wong desired someone ""ruthless"" to be her guardian.

Glas reappears and tries to kill Wee Ming, believing her to be the root of the chaos. During the tense standoff between Hana and Glas, the player is given a choice over which of them should die. This decision will determine the final boss as well as the subsequent ending. On the ""Hard"" difficulty setting, a third option will become available: spare the lives of both Glas and Hana. In this ending, the pair emerge from the smoldering wreckage of the brothel, where they find a befuddled Deke sitting on a toilet. Deke has no memory of being killed, believing he has taken a bump to the head, and asks how they made out on the ""deal"". As he hoists himself out of the pit, Glas is stunned to realize that his left arm has been completely restored. The three partners walk off into the sunrise to continue their exploits.",2000-02-24 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,75.9388,24

131361,8164,Godzilla The Series: Monster Wars,"After receiving word of a mutant attack in Nigeria, Randy Hernandez and Monique Dupre went to investigate alongside Godzilla. After getting past the Nigerian military, Godzilla defeated El Gusano Gigante, leading to Dr. Elsie Chapman discovering that it had been feeding on plants used in the manufacture of chemical weapons. Back in New York, Audrey Timmonds reported on a garbage-eating microbe that had gone on a rampage. H.E.A.T. boarded the Heat-Seeker while Godzilla made his way through the city itself. Once again, the military tried to stop him, but were unable to do so. When he reached the Nanotech Creature, he was able to defeat it, and it dispersed from its conglomerate form, leading Timmonds to commend H.E.A.T.'s efforts in defeating the P.E.M.C. Some time after this, Dr. Chapman picked up strange waves coming from nearby New Jersey. She showed it to her colleague Dr. Mendel Craven, who recognized them as faster-than-light tachyon pulses. The team went to New Jersey to investigate, leaving Godzilla to navigate there underwater, battling through scores of submarines and giant cephalopods. He soon came face to face with a Cryptocledius headed the other direction that attacked him with sonic vocalizations. Not understanding what the beast had been doing there, Craven began looking into them, and determined that they were some sort of distress signal emanating from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, and that it had been signaling for 55 million years. Godzilla then trekked through an unnamed city facing the usual opposing forces until he was faced with a Giant Bat that took a toll on him, but he was able to force into retreat. H.E.A.T. then headed for Site Omega, a military outpost in the Pacific. Godzilla then left the city, battling huge rats in addition to the miliary forces. He then walked all the way to Site Omega on the ocean floor, where he encountered more giant cephalopods and undersea attackers. He eventually arrived on the island and fought through yet another military onslaught before coming face to face with Cyber Godzilla, the resurrected cyborg created from the corpse of Godzilla's mother.[1]. She attacked her son with missiles, but was ultimately lain to waste. After Cyber Godzilla's defeat, the aliens that had apparently been around were seen retreating. Anthony Hicks approached Nick and offered him the position of lead researcher on the incapacitated mutations there on the island, but Nick declined in order to continue protecting the mutations that had yet to be discovered.",2000-11-20 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

165589,9580,Grandia II,"Ryudo is a mercenary, known as a Geohound, and is hired by the Church of Granas to escort Elena, a Songstress of Granas, to Garmia Tower for a ceremony. Upon arrival, he is asked to wait while they perform the ritual. However, he hears a scream and rushes up to the top floor. Seeing everyone dead and Elena with a pair of wings, he rescues her and both return to Carbo village. Back in the village, Ryudo is asked by the priest to escort Elena to St. Heim Papal State to seek Pope Zera to help cleanse Elena of the Wings of Valmar, one of several pieces of Valmar, that now possess her. Before he can turn the job down, the village is attacked by a mysterious winged woman, who engages and defeats Ryudo in battle. She introduces herself as Millennia and disappears. The next morning, Ryudo accepts the job and departs for St. Heim with Elena. In the town of Agear, Millennia appears again, this time more friendly, and teams up with Ryudo. She accidentally reveals herself as the Wings of Valmar and that she possesses Elena, sharing her body as a separate being. The group, eventually joined by Roan and the beast man Mareg, encounters more pieces of Valmar, which Millenia absorbs after defeating them. 
 
When the group arrives at St. Heim Papal State, Elena meets with Pope Zera, who wishes to speak with Ryudo. The Pope requests that he find the legendary Granasaber, a weapon wielded by Granas which was used to defeat Valmar. Ryudo reluctantly agrees, and the group travels to Roan's hometown of Cyrum. Upon arrival, the group rests at the inn as Roan departs. The next morning, it is revealed that Roan is the prince, and that the people of Cyrum once assisted Valmar against Granas in the ancient war. The party enters the castle and finds the Gate of Darkness open and discover an ancient factory underneath the castle. They encounter the Claws of Valmar and, later, Melfice back in the castle. Melfice is Ryudo's brother and the man Mareg seeks, who flees after defeating the group in battle, telling Ryudo to face him at home. Roan is crowned king and chooses to stay in Cyrum, to encourage its people that the past does not predict their future. Tio, the being possessed by the Claws and an Automata, joins the group after being rescued. 
 
The party arrives at the village of Garlan, Ryudo's hometown, by boat, and Ryudo is immediately chastised for returning and commanded to leave. He reveals that Melfice has returned and he plans to kill him to end his torment of the world. At the inn, a disguised Skye reveals Ryudo's history to Elena. Garlan used to be a village of swordsmen, with Melfice being the best. However, one night, during a storm, the idol in the hills grew restless, so the villagers sent Reena, Melfice's fiancé, to pray at the altar. She didn't return, and Melfice investigated, being secretly followed by Ryudo. In the shrine, Ryudo witnessed Melfice murder Reena. Ryudo later fled from town and stayed away for three years, causing the villagers to believe he abandoned them, hence their contempt. In the morning, the group travels up the mountain to confront Melfice. At its peak, they defeat Melfice, who afterwards reconciles with Ryudo and informs the group of the Granasaber's location before dying. While Ryudo grieves, the Horns possess him, causing him to lose consciousness. Back at the Inn, Elena asks Millenia for help, but she initially refuses. However, she relents and uses her powers to seal the Horns inside of Ryudo, who then awakens with a renewed sense of purpose. But Elena questions Granas, as it was Valmar who saved Ryudo. 
 
The group travels to Nannan, Mareg's hometown, near the location of the Granasaber. In the village, Mareg is praised for his successful mission and the group are informed of the Granasaber's whereabouts: within a giant cyclone to the east. The group travels there and deactivates the artificial storm, revealing the Granasaber. However, Selene, the High Priestess, appears and sacrifices a Cathedral Knight to revive the Body of Valmar around the Granasaber, but the group enters the body and destroys it. Tio reveals the Granasaber to be a ship, teleporting the group inside and guiding the giant sword back to St. Heim. The ""Day of Darkness"" arrives, and the group witnesses the Cathedral Knights slaughtering townsfolk, and destroy the Knights. Elena reveals her true mission: to absorb the pieces of Valmar so they could be destroyed by the Granasaber. In the Cathedral, Selene transforms into the Heart of Valmar and the group destroys it. They catch up to Zera, who reveals the truth: that Valmar was victorious in the battle against Granas, who was killed. He declares his intentions of reviving Valmar using Elena, and abducts her to the Moon of Valmar. 
 
The group uses the Granasaber to reach the moon and save Elena. A wounded Mareg later sacrifices himself to allow the group to escape from the moon. Crashing near Cyrum, which is now besieged by monsters from the moon, the group rejoins with Roan and defends the town. Soon, Valmar's Moon crashes into the Granas Cathedral and the new Valmar emerges. Unfortunately, the group finds itself without the means to defeat him. Roan suggests traveling to the nearby Birthplace of the Gods for answers, which reveals much about the ancient war and the origins of both gods. Meeting another Automata named Elmo, Ryudo chooses to confront the Horns within and is beset by many trials. However, he overcomes his fears and insecurities and is granted the true Granasaber. The party challenges Valmar and enters his body. Inside, they are confronted by Zera, who attacks them before sending a false Millenia after them. Ryudo's party is victorious, and the true Millenia, now separated from Elena, joins them. Zera divides the group and launches a final attack against Ryudo, Elena, and Millenia. They defeat him and destroy Valmar for good, restoring peace to the world. 
 
The ending shows the different characters one year after Valmar's defeat. Roan is still king and embarks on a journey to find his friends. Tio has become a nurse in Cyrum, Millenia is a teacher, and Elena tours the world as a singer in a troupe. Elsewhere, Ryudo lays the Granasaber to rest and makes his return to the world.",2000-08-01 00:00:00.000,21,NULL,74.5000,3,78.0652,42

Before the game begins, we are told that Julie has previously killed a tyrant and ""would-be God"" named Lord Tyler (during the events of Heavy Metal 2000), and brought the remnant of her people to a planet called Eden. The people of Eden have made a startling discovery: the waters of the planet grant an eternal life to those who drink it, and they have restored ti-rural paradise, pasturing 'creepers' (large bull-like creatures) and peacefully going about their business.

This planet is camouflaged by a FAKK2 beacon and made to look like a biohazard-strewn wasteland in the hope that it will remain hidden from any threat. However, a creature named Gith, who appears only as a disembodied cybernetic head, runs a hyper-corporation called Gith Industries whose ""employees"" are little more than slaves. He scavenges the universe in a ship composed of three-quarters of a planet, and is headed for a place called Na'ChThraThull, or the ""place of the soft machines"", which turns out to be Eden.

Then a series of explosive asteroids take the planet's shield down, and a number of nasties (actually, Gith's employees) invade the planet. These include huge mosquitoes and their source, a large queen called the Vymish Mama, skinless bearlike Grawlix, plants that shoot poison darts, huge flesh-eating plants, Gith's cybernetic Fleshbinders and Soul Harvesters. Julie, with the help of gunsmith Otto and other citizens, crawls through besieged Eden to reset the shield, in vain as it turns out, then journeys through the swamps to find a character called Gruff, who unlocks the path to the Temple of the We for her. She then overcomes the four challenges of the We before entering the final temple where the Heart of the We is kept. However, Gith is waiting for her, and he steals the Heart and uses it to bring Lord Tyler back to life, so he could have his revenge on Julie. However, Julie fights and kills Lord Tyler and wins the Heart, banishing Gith. She returns to town only to find out that her pregnant sister is kidnapped by Gith, who returns in a giant space station, thus leaving room for a sequel and/or suggesting future action.",2000-08-04 00:00:00.000,7,NULL,70.0000,1,79.9845,18

Warlords of the Wasteland (2000). Tarnum's original story, as a young Barbarian leading an uprising against the oppressive Wizard-Kings of Bracaduun. 
 
Conquest of the Underworld (2000). Tarnum's first adventure as the Immortal Hero as he adopts the guise of an Erathian Knight in a campaign against the Demons, Necromancers and Warlocks of the Underworld. 
 
Masters of the Elements (2000). Tarnum becomes that which he hates most, a Wizard, in a hectic bid to assist the Wizards of Bracada in their quest to save the planet from the destructive Elemental Lords. 
 
Clash of the Dragons (2000). Tarnum takes up the bow and defends the Elves and Dwarves of AvLee as a Ranger while opposing the tyrannical Queen of Nighon, Mutare, and her legions of murderous Dragons. 
 
The World Tree (2000). As a Barbarian, Tarnum defends the World Tree in northeastern Antagarich from evil Barbarians and Necromancers led by the demigod Vorr. This was available as a free download for those who purchased two Heroes Chronicles games, but the installer could only recognize the North American version. 
 
The Fiery Moon (2000). The sequel to The World Tree continues Tarnum's quest as, in hot pursuit of Vorr, he travels to a moon populated by the demonic Kreegan. This was available as a free download for those who purchased three Heroes Chronicles games, but the installer could only recognize the North American version. 
 
Revolt of the Beastmasters (2001). Tarnum travels to the Mudlands of Tatalia, becoming a Beastmaster to free the Mudlanders from the oppression he brought upon them centuries ago. This campaign was one of two included in the single-disc installment, The Final Chapters. 
 
The Sword of Frost (2001). Tarnum must become a Dungeon Overlord of Nighon to stop his former friend, the Elven Hero Gelu, from discovering the Sword of Frost.

34508,8435,Heroes Chronicles: Clash of the Dragons,"In Clash of the Dragons, the good dragons leave AvLee. Having lived with these green and gold dragons for twenty years, Tarnum sets out on a quest to find them. He leaves Adrienne, the fire witch, to look after the orphan boy Waerjak while he is gone. Tarnum appoints the dwarf Kurbon as his master of supplies, and the elves appoint the druid Aspen as Tarnum's advisor. Tarnum and Aspen frequently play chess together, but Tarnum's aggressive tactics cause him to lose each time.

Tarnum speaks to the Dragontalker about the disappearance of the good dragons. The Dragontalker tells Tarnum about Mutare, an overlord who used the Vial of Dragon's Blood to turn herself into the Dragon Queen of Nighon, thus enslaving all dragons, good and evil, to her will. Tarnum steals this vial and uses it on the ten kidnapped Gold Dragon Mothers in order to restore the good dragons to their normal selves. While he does so, he rescues the ranger Valita from a demonic prison. Aspen, once a great spy, suspects Captain Valita of spying for Nighon, but Tarnum refuses to believe this.

Tarnum continues to battle against Mutare, even after she gains power over the mighty Rust, Crystal and Azure Dragons. To gain an advantage over Mutare, Tarnum seeks the aid of the Faerie Dragons. Aspen captures the harpy messenger who carries the spy reports to and from Nighon. The harpy claims that the notes are stuck to a tree with an arrow of green and black fletchings (the colors of Valita's arrows). Tarnum realizes that Kurbon is the spy because he knows all the troop movements and supplies the arrows for Valita whom he trained while in the Forest Guard. Kurbon shoots Aspen (who dies a few weeks later) before fleeing into Nighon.

Tarnum's lightning assault pushes Mutare back into Nighon territory, but now she focuses all of her forces against him. Valita is captured by the traitor, Kurbon. Tarnum eventually frees her by reminding Kurbon of who he really is, which leads to dwarf's second betrayal, this time of Mutare. Kurbon sacrifices his troops and his own life to liberate Valita. After Tarnum's victory on the border, Mutare is forced to retreat further into Nighon to plot Tarnum's death. Tarnum progresses further into Nighon and battles Mutare herself, crushing her armies and forcing her to flee. While weakened Mutare plans her revenge in Nighon, she is killed by unknown person in a coup for power, just like she herself once came to rule the Dungeons. Tarnum is called away again by the Ancestors, but he will always remember the time he spent in AvLee as the happiest time of his life.",2000-11-15 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,40.7651,7
34430,7867,Heroes Chronicles: Conquest of the Underworld,"In Conquest of the Underworld, some years after Rion Gryphonheart's death, his soul is stolen from Paradise and taken into the depths of the Underworld. The Ancestors send Tarnum to aid Queen Allison of Erathia in saving her father's soul. On the first layer of the Underworld, Tarnum searches for the Orb of Inhibition so that the Boatman will take him to the next level. Allison wishes to accompany Tarnum in battle, but Tarnum insists that she stay behind practicing.

In the second layer of the Underworld, Tarnum and his men are affected by ghosts from their past. From his nightmares, Tarnum learns that his older sister was almost killed by his Barbarian armies, but was saved by Rion Gryphonheart and later became pregnant with his child. Tarnum learns that this child is Allison, and keeps his identity hidden from his men. After facing the Necromancers in order to travel to the third layer, Tarnum learns the name of the demon who stole Rion's soul. His name is Jorm, and he lives in the lower layers of the Underworld.

Deezelisk, Duke of the Bottom, is a powerful demon who once attempted to invade Erathia but was defeated in battle and blinded by Rion Gryphonheart when he tried to gain a foothold in the upper world. Tarnum seeks the Pendant of Second Sight to restore Deezelisk's sight in return for Jorm's location. During this time, Tarnum's Captain of Information, Mensor, discovers who Tarnum truly is, but he decides to keep quiet when Tarnum tells him that Allison is his niece. Tarnum kills Jorm and saves the soul of Rion Gryphonheart.

During the battle against Jorm, Deezelisk's forces turn on Allison, and Allison is kidnapped. The demons kill Tarnum and all of his forces, but he returns due to his role as the Immortal Hero and manages to escape the battlefield. Rion's spirit forgives Tarnum, and after regrouping his scattered armies and fighting some major battles, Tarnum defeats Deezelisk and saves Allison.

124452,8434,Heroes Chronicles: Masters of the Elements,"In Masters of the Elements, a ten thousand-year truce between the Elemental Lords of Air, Earth, Water, and Fire comes to an end. The Ancestors send Tarnum to stop this feud before it destroys the material world. The only way to access the elemental planes is to take control of the last remaining Elemental Conflux in Enroth. Using the forces of Gavin Magnus, the Immortal Grand Vizier of Bracada, Tarnum conquers the last Conflux and discovers the location of the Gateway to the Clouds.

Upon reaching the Plane of Air, Tarnum discovers that Shalwend, Lord of Air, has already departed his realm. When Shalwend destroys the Gateway to the Clouds behind Tarnum, Tarnum is forced to find another way to return to his world. He must become a master of all four elements before returning to Antagarich. He next travels to the Plane of Water where he learns that Acwalander, the Water Lord, has left his realm as well.

In the Plane of Earth, Tarnum is shocked to find that Reamus (a wizard who traveled to the plane 200 years ago) is still alive. Even stranger, only 16 years have passed on the Plane of Earth in that time. As Gralkor, the Earth Lord, has also left his plane, Tarnum and his men realize that the Elemental Lords are using the time variations between the material world and the planes in order to gain a foothold in the material world before Tarnum can return.

While in the Plane of Fire, Reamus and Barsolar (King Magnus's cousin and advisor to Tarnum) learn of the Plane of Magic. Magic binds the elements together, so they know it will give them the advantage they will need against the Elemental Lords. After receiving the aid of the magic elementals and returning to the Plane of Fire to free the Phoenixes enslaved by Pyrannaste, Lord of Fire, Tarnum leads his army back to the material world.

Thirty years have passed in the world since Tarnum had left. King Magnus brings an army to support Tarnum. While they are in camp, Magnus and Tarnum exchange stories. Tarnum learns that one of his Behemoths killed Magnus centuries ago in the battle for Castle Steelhorn, and that Magnus somehow awoke to find himself immortal and later became King of Bracada. However, Tarnum finds Magnus to be arrogant and self-righteous, refusing to consort with the man. Once the Elemental Lords are defeated, Tarnum sends his elemental troops back to their planes. He coldly lets Gavin Magnus know that the elementals will never return to Antagarich (even though they later do so in Armageddon's Blade) then asks the Magic Elementals to destroy all Confluxes and all records of the elemental planes before returning to his life as a Barbarian.",2000-11-15 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,41.4350,7

He is drawn further northeast across an inhospitable desert and into a tall, nameless mountain range. Along the way, he encounters an injured familiar named Skizzik who has fled from Vorr's armies. Skizzik tells Tarnum that the Ancestors are imprisoned on the Fiery Moon, which can only be reached through the Sparkling Bridge. The Sparkling Bridge is an ancient portal capable of instigating travel to any world in the universe. It has been guarded by the elementals since the dawn of time and requires the Ring of the Wayfarer to be operated. 
 
Tarnum travels to the Fiery Moon and frees the two remaining sane Ancestors from Xyron, the Jailer. The Ancestors give Tarnum sap from the World Tree which will help him cure their brother, Vorr. However, Tarnum's loses his battle against Vorr's army. Grumba also dies in the battle, but Skizzik survives. After rebuilding his forces, Tarnum is intent on killing Vorr this time, but the other Ancestors convince him to use the sap because if Tarnum kills Vorr, he and the other Ancestors will die and enter Oblivion as well. Tarnum reaches Vorr and gives him the sap which cures his madness. For the first time, Tarnum feels he really can change his cruel barbarian ways.",2000-11-15 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,30.5867,5
96351,13363,Heroes Chronicles: The World Tree,"In The World Tree, Tarnum hears a voice in his dreams telling him to ""Save the World Tree!"" He travels hundreds of miles northeast to an ancient cave and joins the remnants of a barbarian tribe apparently meant to protect it. Recently, necromancers have invaded the cavern, so Tarnum assumes that the Ancestors send him here to stop the necromancers from destroying the World Tree. He learns from five shamans in the area that the World Tree brings life to all things. However, he still doesn't know where or what it is. Deeper in the caverns, Tarnum finds a barbarian tribe which is working with the necromancers. They claim to follow Vorr, one of the three Ancestors who has turned into a barbarian war god. 
 
Tarnum enters a lush cavern, believing that the World Tree must be nearby. Tarnum thinks that if he can convince the barbarians not to follow Vorr, Vorr will weaken. The mortal leader of the barbarian Followers of Vorr, King Targor, models his rule after Tarnum the Barbarian Tyrant, so Tarnum sends Grumba, an ogre who is his second-in-command, to search for the Pendant of Total Recall. This will allow Targor to see the experiences Tarnum has been forced to undergo over all the centuries following his tyrannical rule, and will hopefully end Targor's madness. 
 
An elven druid named Nilidon who comes to aid Tarnum tells him that the tunnel system Tarnum has been in is in fact the World Tree, also known as the Roots of Life. Tarnum finds the Pendant of Total Recall, letting Targor see the error in his ways. Targor turns his army against Vorr and dies fighting him. Vorr gives up on destroying the World Tree, and the remaining barbarians kill the remaining necromancers.

Once upon a time, the great barbarian King Jarg ruled over those lands. But then the Wizards of Bracaduun came and enslaved the barbarian people. Young Tarnum learns the long-lost history of his people from the last bards and decides to do anything to break the Wizards' rule. Becoming the new Barbarian King, he leads the clans against Bracaduun.

After the death of the woman he fell in love with, Yalla, and the murder of one of the bards by the wizards, Tarnum's noble intentions become a sinister quest for blood and revenge. Decided to destroy the Wizard-Kings at all costs, he enslaves the inhabitants of the Mudlands and orders villages of ""traitors"" to be burned to the ground, even causing the death of one of his long-lost sisters.

After months of campaign and terrible battles, his advisors express their hope to get back to their home, but Tarnum doesn't listen, obsessed by taking the fortress of Steelhorn. To avoid a rebellion, he has his advisors poisoned, including his old friend Hardac. Accusing the Wizards of his crime, he turns his army into a blood-thirsty Horde. Victory is at hand, but at a terrible cost: Tarnum is now known as the Barbarian Tyrant and has become everything he despised in the Wizards.

Some time later, survivors from Bracaduun flee to the north and found the kingdom of Erathia. During a campaign to conquer the young kingdom, Tarnum is defeated by its first king Rion Gryphonheart. Tarnum soon discovers that Paradise is closed to him. Because of his crimes against his own people, the Ancestors have cursed him to wander the world eternally until he make up for ""the tremendous wrongs he performed"".

167126,144507,James Bond 007: The World Is Not Enough,"The game closely follows the plot of the film. MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Bilbao, Spain to meet a Swiss banker and retrieve money for Robert King, a friend of M who purchased a classified report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department. The report, which was taken from a dead MI6 agent, is believed to contain information about terrorists who have attacked King's oil pipeline in Kazakhstan. Bond asks the banker who killed the MI6 agent, but he is unexpectedly killed by an assassin. Bond escapes with the money and takes it to the MI6 headquarters in London. A terrorist group then launches an attack on the MI6 headquarters, prompting Bond to pursue the assassin through a London Underground station. Bond offers her protection, but she ultimately kills herself by exploding a hot air balloon. The MI6 traces the recovered money to a KGB agent-turned-terrorist known as Renard, who previously kidnapped King's daughter, Elektra. M assigns Bond to protect Elektra, who is about to oversee the construction of an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan.

During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Bond suspects the attack was caused by Elektra's head of security, Davidov, and decides to kill him before taking his place on a flight to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. There, Bond meets nuclear physicist Christmas Jones and learns that Renard managed to steal plutonium from a nuclear warhead. To get a lead on where Renard might be hiding, Bond visits a former Russian mafia adversary, Valentin Zukovsky, who reveals that Elektra was in exchange for the use of a submarine currently being captained by his nephew. Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. In Istanbul, Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the Maiden's Tower. With the help of Zukovsky, Bond kills Elektra and boards the submarine. Ultimately, Bond finds Renard in the submarine's reactor and kills him before escaping with Jones.",2000-10-17 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

181823,1569,Jet Grind Radio,"DJ Professor K broadcasts the Jet Set Radio pirate radio station to gangs of youths who roam Tokyo-to, skating and spraying graffiti. One gang, the GGs, competes for turf with the all-female Love Shockers in the shopping districts of Shibuya-Cho, the cyborg Noise Tanks in the Benten entertainment district, and the kaiju-loving Poison Jam in the Kogane dockyard. The authorities, led by Captain Onishima, pursue the gangs with riot police and military armaments. After the GGs defeat Poison Jam, Noise Tanks, and Love Shockers in turf wars, they each drop a piece of a mysterious vinyl record. Professor K says that the mysterious vinyl has the power to summon a demon.

The GGs are joined by Combo and Cube, who explain that their hometown, Grind City, has been overtaken by the Rokkaku business conglomerate. They ask the GGs to help them to free their friend, Coin, who has been captured by the Rokkaku. The Rokkaku pursue the GGs and steal the vinyl record. Poison Jam explains that the Rokkaku CEO, Goji Rokkaku, plans to use the record to make a contract with the demon and take over the world. The GGs defeat Goji in the rooftop of his headquarters by destroying his turntable. Freedom is returned to the streets of Tokyo-to.

This power, however, draws the attention of Dark Matter, who wishes to use the great Crystal for its own evil agenda. Its gigantic mass attacks and searches for the Crystal, blackening the sky and sending the fairies into panic. In response to the threat Dark Matter presents, the queen of Ripple Star orders a fairy named Ribbon to take the Crystal to a safe place. Ribbon tries to fly away with the Crystal in tow, but is stopped by three orbs sent by Dark Matter. The Crystal shatters into 74 shards, scattered throughout several planets, and Ribbon crashes onto Planet Popstar. Kirby finds one shard and gives it to Ribbon, whereupon the two set out to find the others. Once Kirby and his friends collect every Crystal Shard and defeat Miracle Matter, Dark Matter flees Ripple Star and explodes. The victory is cut short, however, as the Crystal detects a powerful presence of Dark Matter energy within the Fairy Queen and expels it from her, manifesting over the planet to create Dark Star.

181233,786,MechWarrior 4: Vengeance,"The FedCom Civil War engulfs Kentares IV after William Dresari, a nephew of famed Clan War hero Duke Eric Dresari, betrays the family, launching a surprise attack by Steiner forces on the Dresari royal palace. William seizes the throne for himself under the banner of Katherine ""Katrina"" Steiner-Davion's Lyran Alliance and became responsible for the annihilation of loyalists to Victor Steiner-Davion. The betrayal leaves Eric Dresari and the majority of the royal family dead.

Upon hearing of the coup, Eric's son, Ian Dresari, returns home and meets up with his uncle, Sir Peter Dresari, on the moon orbiting Kentares to launch a guerrilla campaign to take back Kentares IV from the Steiner loyalists. Ian fights alongside with fellow Resistance MechWarriors Casey Nolan, Jen McQuarrie, and Jules Gonzales, and their commander Elise Rathburn in various missions. The Resistance abandons its base on the moon and sets up camp for the first time in Kentares' arctic regions. At one point during this campaign, Ian's uncle Peter is murdered by Duncan Burke, a high-ranking officer in Katrina's forces. Ian and the rest of the Resistance are devastated by the loss of his uncle and debate over whether or not to continue the fight for Kentares' freedom. They decide to push forward and manage to capture a satellite network from House Steiner. The rebel group moves into the mountains.

After destroying a disabled, but heavily guarded Steiner DropShip, Ian and the resistance move to the Hadra Peninsula, a remote desert region. Rumors of an abandoned prison camp reached the resistance and efforts are made to locate and liberate the camp in order to enlist more personnel for the Resistance cause. Along the way, Ian is shocked to find that one member of his family survived Steiner's siege of the Dresari palace: his sister Joanna. After a short reunion, Ian and Joanna are separated once more as the Resistance plans to mobilize their forces to take the fight to Steiner. While in Hadra, Ian kills James Kulin, who was tasked with suppressing the civilian population of Kentares and personally gave the orders to execute Ian and Joanna's family. They make a brief detour to save a coastal town named Vale after Steiner threatened to bomb the town due to allegations of links to the Resistance. Not only does the Resistance save the population, but Ian manages to personally defeat his uncle's murderer, Duncan Burke, in a heated duel.

Pushing forward into urban environments, the fighting heats up and the Resistance's casualties mount. Joanna informs Ian of an old armory cache hidden somewhere in the city full of equipment enough to outfit four heavy lances of 'Mechs - valuable for assaulting the Dresari palace, now the headquarters for the Steiner occupation. Before the search for the cache could be conducted however, Joanna and her lance are ambushed by Steiner forces, leaving her badly injured and in mortal danger. Ian has to make a choice, between rescuing his sister from certain death or securing the weapons cache for an assault on the Dresari palace. Whatever the player chooses, Ian and the Resistance fight one last battle against House Steiner, finally putting an end to the war. However, the fight is not yet over for Ian, as William shows up in a modified Daishi, challenging Ian to a duel. Ian defeats William and finally frees the planet from Steiner's grasp.

Depending what choice the player makes during the second-to-last mission, either Joanna or Ian will ascend the throne as Duchess or Duke, respectively.",2000-11-22 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,70.4460,10

However, the pages of the book soon scatter across London and Palethorn gains a demonlike appearance as a result. The spell Palethorn casts once again brings Sir Dan, who was resting at a nearby museum, back to life. He is recruited by a professor named Hamilton Kift and his ghostly sidekick Winston to recover the pages of Zarok's spellbook and put a stop to Palethorn's plans. Along the way, they end up being joined by an ancient mummy princess named Kiya, who becomes Dan's love interest.

The year is 1927. Stanton is in the drawing room of his Providence, Rhode Island home when his childhood friend, Edgar, appears at his door.

Still reeling from Edgar’s appearance, Stanton is visited by a doctor who tells him that Edgar has lost his mind and must be institutionalized.

Following the Necromancers' defeat, Jandor trapped their souls within the magical Orb, which the Arch-Wizard Horvath then transported to another dimension later revealed to be modern Earth. One of Jandor's last deeds of the war was saving a female infant he found in the Necromancers' lair: unsure what to do with a possible Necromancer offspring, he left the girl in the care of an Ogre village. He then disassembled the Staff and gave each piece to one of the three powerful factions in the game: the Fire Knights of the fortress Dün Mir (the Halberd of Horrendous), the wizards of Castle Galava (the Heart of Nox), and the conjurers' Temple of Ix (the Weirdling Beast).

The Mollusc smashes the Artifact and in a mighty explosion of power, its four fragmented pieces are scattered across time and space. The player's challenge as Pac-Man is to retrieve the Artifact's four pieces from the now ghost-infested time periods and return them to the present. Professor Pac-Man prepares an unpredictable, hastily constructed Time Machine to help Pac-Man on his quest. 
 
Pac-Man initially travels through four different time-periods, including prehistoric times, Ancient Egypt, the Middle Ages, and the Wild West. Although the Time Machine sometimes malfunctions, sending Pac-Man to an unexpected place and time, he is eventually able to obtain in each era one of the four pieces of the Artifact. Afterwards, the Time Machine malfunctions again before Pac-Man can return to the present, instead bringing him to a fifth time-period: the future. Professor Pac-Man claims that an alternate power source is needed to bring him home from the future. In this fifth time-period, Pac-Man finally comes to the Reactor Core and is able to harness its energy to be finally transported, with the Artifact reassembled, to the second after the Mollusc broke the Artifact in the game's introduction scene. Aiming the now-repaired Artifact at the Mollusc, Pac-Man fires a beam of light at his foe, vaporizing the Mollusc and grinning triumphantly.",2000-10-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

161714,1464,Perfect Dark,"Set in early 2022, Perfect Dark follows agent Joanna Dark during the final stages of her training at the Carrington Institute, a research centre founded by Daniel Carrington. After completing her training, Joanna is sent on a mission to destroy a cyborg manufacturing facility in the South American jungle. The facility is run by Mink Hunter and produces high-tech weaponry for terrorist operations. Joanna completes her mission successfully, killing Hunter and destroying the entire facility. She then reports that, during her landing in the jungle, she witnessed an aircraft being shot down and made a note of the coordinates. Carrington learns that there is a UFO in the area and that dataDyne, the Carrington Institute's rival corporation, is getting away with the alien wreckage.

Joanna is sent to investigate the crash site, but is ultimately captured and taken to the Pelagic I research vessel, along with the alien wreckage. An alien eventually rescues Joanna, telling her that she must gather as much information on the alien wreckage as possible, and then sink the Pelagic I. After succeeding, Joanna tells Carrington that the wreckage belonged to an alien race called the Skedar. The situation changes abruptly when the Carrington Institute is stormed by a dataDyne strike team who hopes to destroy any evidence against them. Joanna defends the Carrington Institute and her work earns her enough recognition to take part in her next mission. The game ends with the Carrington Institute carrying out further investigations on dataDyne.",2000-08-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,73.0000,2

Kurow Kirishima: a cold-hearted and ruthless ninja assassin from a mysterious group known only as the ""Reverse Society"" has his sight set on the Imawano family and plans to eliminate them and their allies so that he can prepare for the advancement of his own ambition to rule Japan. To this end, he attacks Raizo Imawano: the principal of Justice High and father to Batsu, so that he can easily put him out of commission and not have any interference come from him. Secondly, he sends both his older sister Yurika Kirishima and his loyal subordinate Momo Karuizawa into the ranks of the fighters so that the two of them can cause tension and distrust to occur between the friends. His third plot involves brainwashing Gedo gang leader Daigo Kazama so that he can order him into forcing his gang to attack various schools in order to cause even more tension to occur. Lastly, Kurow himself plans to destroy Batsu's reputation by disguising himself as Batsu's doppelganger (named Vatsu) so that he can attack the fighters and make them believe that Batsu is behind it.

Batsu and his friends must fight back against the evil plot of Kurow and attempt to not let their friendship get destroyed by the conspiracy of a deadly ninja assassin.",2000-12-01 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,80.9101,15

Checking it, he discovers that it is the top work from Seca, a sturdy and powerful super energy combat armor that can make anyone a hero, but it requires batteries to work. Also, as it is a rental suit, Tarou decides to start a rental job under the name Rent a Hero, and distributes flyers around the town to take requests. The money he gains is used for the costume's monthly rental fee and for batteries. 
 
After finishing the distribution and returning home to play on his creamcast (the game's save point), he went out to check the town and saw a man harassing a woman, entering in a fight against him. Although helping outside the shop requests won't give rewards, it rises awareness of the hero, improving his career. Tarou then gradually gains experience and becomes a famous hero.",2000-05-25 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

114945,19007,Skies of Arcadia,"The game takes place in the fictional skies referred to as Arcadia, where six civilizations coexist on floating continents orbited by six moons of different colors. Thousands of years prior to the present time of the game, the civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, controlled by a Moon Crystal. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, threatening the extinction of humanity. The most advanced, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroyed the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent it from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away, while each civilization worked on rebuilding itself.

Vyse and Aika are members of the Blue Rogues, a faction of Robin Hood-minded air pirates gathered together to resist the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire. Led by Empress Teodora, the empire seeks the Moon Crystals to reawaken the Gigas and take over the world. Teodara directs the Valuan Armada, a fleet of warships led by admirals Galcian and Ramirez, to find them. Upon the Silver Civilization learning of this plan, they send Fina to find the Moon Crystals first. She is captured by the Armada, but saved by Vyse and Aika, who, with mutual enemies, agree to help her mission.",2000-10-05 00:00:00.000,12,NULL,90.0000,1,86.3665,32

51048,18902,Star Trek - Armada,"The storyline references several media in the Star Trek universe, incorporating plot elements from television shows Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: The Next Generation as well as the then-recently released film Star Trek: Insurrection.

Following the Dominion War, the Federation turns to rebuilding. However, a Federation timeship, the USS Premonition, suddenly appears from the future, under attack by the Borg. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, commanding the USS Enterprise-E, comes to its aid. The Premonition's captain, Thaddeus Demming, warns Picard of an upcoming Borg invasion. Picard then repels an initial Borg attack on a Federation outpost.

Elsewhere, Commander Worf assists in the defense of the Ba'ku homeworld from the Son'a, after which he is informed of the Enterprise's discovery. While traveling through a hazardous sector of space on his way back to Qo'nos, he is ambushed by his old enemy, Toral, who plans to use a fake Sword of Kahless to take over the Klingon Empire. Toral ambushes Chancellor Martok following another Borg incursion, and another Klingon civil war ensues. After a climactic battle over the Klingon homeworld, Toral is defeated. He retreats to the Neutral Zone, revealing that he was getting assistance from the Romulan Star Empire. Hostilities ensue between the Klingons and the Romulans.

The Romulans, in the meantime, come across a stable Omega Particle, a source of nearly limitless power. The particle, discovered first by a Ferengi mining guild, is about to be sold to the Cardassians; the Tal Shiar sends Admiral Sela to secure it before that happens. Sela captures the Omega Particle and, despite some Borg interference, delivers it to a fortified Romulan base. She then allies with the Borg promising the particle after they destroy Toral's remaining forces, but she then betrays and attacks them after Toral is defeated.

The Borg, wanting to secure the particle at all costs, assimilate a Dominion cloning facility and use it to clone Locutus, the former title of Jean-Luc Picard when he was assimilated. With Locutus leading their armada, the Borg take the Omega Particle from the Romulans and assimilate Ambassador Spock, who is trying to mediate between the Klingons and Romulans. Without him, the two empires go to war, and the Borg are able to enter the Sol system. Locutus and his armada defeat the Federation fleet, kill Worf and Demming, and assimilate Earth. However, Picard and the Enterprise manage to escape through a temporal vortex created by the Premonition.

Going back in time, the Enterprise prevents Spock's assimilation. Picard and Spock are able to forge an alliance among the Romulans and the Klingons, and together the three governments repel the invasion of Earth. The unified Klingon, Romulan and Federation forces push the Borg out of the Alpha Quadrant and capture a Transwarp Gate which they take to Unimatrix One, at the heart of the Borg Collective. There, they discover the Omega Particle is fueling the Borg war machine. The combined force destroys the Omega Particle, but Locutus travels back in time before he can be defeated.

Back in time, Locutus, in a Borg Sphere, tries to kill Picard aboard the USS Enterprise-D shortly after the Farpoint mission. However, Locutus is thwarted by the USS Premonition which, unaffected by the changes to the timeline, pursues Locutus back in time and destroys his ship. When a battle-weary Premonition returns to the ""present"" and witnesses that all has returned to normal, Demming sends the ship and crew home to a brighter future. The game ends with a final log entry from Picard, noting the departure of the Premonition, as well as the potential disintegration of the Klingon-Romulan alliance, though Picard notes that 'whether the peace will last or not, only time will tell'.",2000-02-29 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,76.3893,6

23627,11230,StarLancer,"It is the year 2160. Mankind has colonized the solar system and two political entities have emerged: the Alliance consisting of American, Australian, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British and German forces, and The Coalition of Russian, Chinese and Middle-Eastern interests. The game begins with a surprise attack on Fort Kennedy, where a peace treaty turns into a bloodbath: all of the inner four planets are overrun, including Terra herself, and the Italian and French fleets are utterly lost. The Alliance fleet regroups at Triton, Neptune's moon, and attempts to regain lost territory. The player takes the role of a rookie pilot in the international 45th Volunteers squadron, under the command of Captain Robert Foster and Wing Commander Maria Enriquez, aboard the re-commissioned British carrier ANS Reliant.

As with Wing Commander: Prophecy, the pilot's flying ability is the only meter by which success and failure is measured, though Starlancer does not feature as many branching mission paths. As in Wing Commander I the pilot may be promoted throughout the course of the campaign; unlike WCI, their rank determines which fighters and missiles they may choose to employ during each mission. The game provides a ""virtual carrier"" through which to navigate, including nearby crewmembers whose reaction to you depends on your current rank and standing. However, the true gem of the game lies in its textual and video news broadcasts, which keep the player informed as to the status of the rest of the war, which seems to be progressing just over the horizon. Players frequently find themselves flying alongside squadrons and pilots they have heard about on the news just recently, providing a dose of 'celebrity exposure' and also increasing the sensation that they are just one part of a much larger war effort.

Starlancer's story is continued in Chris Roberts' Freelancer project, though the two belong to different subgenres (the first is purely focused on action, the latter also features trading and the player can freely move through the game's universe when they are not on a mission.)",2000-03-31 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,70.0000,1,85.7503,9

192981,4116,Syphon Filter 2,"Hours after the events of the first game, Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing are enemies of the state to the Agency after uncovering its connection to Syphon Filter, labeled as terrorists to the general public. Agency operative Dillon Morgan captures Lian at the PharCom warehouses, forcing Gabe and the CBDC soldiers to rendezvous with ex-Agency operative Teresa Lipan in Arizona. Simultaneously, the Agency scrambles a squadron of F-22 Raptors to intercept their transport over the Colorado Rockies, so Gabe and CBDC Lieutenant Jason Chance head down the mountain in search of their plane and a box of PharCom data disks. Agency operative Steven Archer attempts to stop them at all costs.

A group of conspirators, including Mara Aramov and Agency director Lyle Stevens, make a deal to deliver the virus to a rogue Chinese general named Shi-Hao. Meanwhile, Lian recovers in a U.S. Air Force base where Morgan, Derek Falkan, and Thomas Holman are working with Dr. Elsa Weissinger of PharCom to extract infected plasma from test subjects. Lian learns that the other subject was PharCom CEO Jonathan Phagan, who survived his gunshot wound long enough for the Agency to take the plasma. Weissinger protests that Phagan is useful and should be kept alive for further research, but Morgan, not intending that the U.S. government find Pharcom's CEO infected with an unknown virus, deactivates his life support, tying up a loose end.

Lian escapes the medical building and interrogates Holman to learn that Morgan is planning another operation to the PharCom Expo Center to find an encryption disk. She leaves the base in a helicopter after killing Falkan and teams up with Gabe to battle Archer's forces. Gabe shoots Archer during his escape, and recovers the PharCom data.

The protagonists follow Holman's lead to the Expo Center and kill Morgan before he can recover the disk he sought. After decrypting the PharCom data, Teresa realises that some information is missing. The other half must be with Russian SVR director Uri Gregorov, who appeared at the warehouses before Gabe left. Since Lian and Uri know each other, they agree to meet in Moscow.

Aramov instigates a gunfight while they meet and Lian pursues Gregorov. Lian later learns he is an impostor working for Mara and trying to find the other half of the data. The man admits that the real Gregorov is in a Russian gulag, Aljir Prison, which once held Lian captive. Gregorov uncovered a plot to sell the virus to Shi-Hao, so Aramov intervened. Lian stops Gregorov's execution, but is almost killed by the virus and collapses. Gabe takes her back to the States, while Gregorov promises to handle Shi-Hao.

Gabe and Teresa arrive back at the Virginia safehouse overseen by Lawrence Mujari, a freelance pathologist. They decide to trade the PharCom data to the Agency for Lian's vaccine. Director Stevens double-crosses Gabe in the Agency's New York City labs, but Logan escapes and forces Dr. Weissinger to give him the vaccine. Gabe also finds out that Chance survived the mission in Colorado, and sets him free.

Pursued by NYPD SWAT cops and Agency personnel, Gabe hurries back to their helicopter. Along the way, Logan is forced to provide cover for a SWAT officer whose partner is wounded. He does so, but Stevens, who later takes the cop hostage, orders him to drop his weapons. Despite Logan complying in surrender, Stevens kills the officer anyway. Before he can get shot, Gabe is thrown into the sewers by an explosion that Teresa sets off. Gabe assumes that Chance was killed in the labs since Teresa says he never made it to the helicopter. Gabe and Teresa eventually corner Stevens and Gabe shoots him in cold blood.

Gabe and Teresa reach the helicopter to find Chance waiting in impenetrable Agency-issued body armor. He was really working for them, and he shoots Teresa. Gabe suspected it since the Agency always knew where he was in Colorado. Both men fight, and Gabe kills the man he trusted with an assault shotgun that drives Chance into the helicopter blades, decapitating him.

A news report reveals that the Agency's existence is now public, and U.S. Secretary of State Vincent Hadden promises that the government will investigate. Gabe cures Lian and demarcates a grave for Teresa. He, Lian, and Lawrence hold a small memorial and promise to keep fighting, while soldiers watch them from a distance. In a post-credits scene, Hadden and Aramov emerge from a helicopter, with Aramov saying that the Administration will soon fall allowing Hadden to become President. Although a team of soldiers requests for permission to kill Gabe and his team, Hadden calls off the operation, telling Mara he has other plans for Gabe. Aramov laughs as the screen fades to black.",2000-03-14 00:00:00.000,24,NULL,NULL,NULL,79.6911,59

178959,1202,Tales of Eternia,"The game follows Reid Hershel as he tries to prevent the Grand Fall, a cataclysmic event that would destroy his planet along with that of newly found traveling companion Meredy. Specifically, the Grand Fall entails the violent collision of twin planets Inferia and Celestia. The two planets, face one another, separated by the Orbus Barrier. Interaction between the two planets has been infrequent over the last few centuries despite their proximity; the Bridge of Light linked Inferia and Celestia in the distant past, but the link has been severed for an extensive period of time. The Aurora War, an ancient conflict that set Inferia against Celestia over two thousand years ago, continues to generate persistent mistrust between the two groups. The Orbus Barrier has shown recent signs of weakening and possible collapse due to the actions of an unknown external force.

The journey takes Reid across both planets, as he seeks out those responsible for this movement towards the brink of annihilation.",2000-11-30 00:00:00.000,8,NULL,80.0000,1,80.5385,26

96952,4114,Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins,"The game is intended as a prequel to the game Tenchu: Stealth Assassins and depicts the series' heroes Rikimaru and Ayame as teens, being taught by their elderly master named Shiunsai as well as another Azuma ninja named Tatsumaru. The game reveals how Rikumaru got the famous scar over his right eye (not depicted in the game's cover).

The Azuma Ninja have served the House of Gohda for countless generations. Now three young ninja, Rikimaru, Ayame, and Tatsumaru, must protect Lord Gohda Matsunoshin against a coup d'état attempt and a mysterious ninja group calling themselves the Burning Dawn.

After the three ninja are accepted into the Azuma clan, they are called to Gohda castle, which is under attack by Lord Gohda's uncle, Motohide. After a bloody battle, which includes the death of Lady Kei, Lord Gohda's wife, and the kidnapping of Princess Kiku, Lord Gohda's daughter, Rikimaru stops Motohide from killing Lord Gohda, but can't stop Motohide from escaping. It turns out that Motohide was working for a rival Lord, Lord Toda. Toda kills Motohide, only to be killed himself and decapitated by Lady Kagami, the leader of Lord Toda's ninja. She is leading a group of rebel ninja group calling themselves the Burning Dawn, consisting of Suzaku, Genbu, Seiryu, and Byakko, the four Lords of the Burning Dawn, and led by Lady Kagami. To make matters worse, the recently made leader of the Azuma Ninja, Tatsumaru, has gone missing. It is later revealed that Tatsumaru has lost his memory and is now part of the Burning Dawn. Rikimaru and Ayame now have to save Lord Gohda, and stop a ninja uprising intended to plunge the country back into the civil war.

The Burning Dawn has its origins when Lord Gohda's uncle Motohide allied himself with a warlord called Toda Yoshisada in order take control over his kingdom. Toda launched an attack against Gohda castle which resulted in the death of Lord Gohda's wife Lady Kei and the kidnapping of his daughter Princess Kiku. Motohide is later betrayed and killed by Toda, only to be betrayed and killed himself by his chief assassin Lady Kagami: the founder of the Burning Dawn. Over an unknown period of time following the death of Lord Toda, the Burning Dawn partake in a series of underground criminal activities such as kidnapping, theft, forced labor, smuggling and murder. This in turn attracts the attention of Lord Gohda and the Azuma Ninja, who make efforts to end the illegal activities of the organization.

The end finally arrives when the Burning Dawns hierarchy and its flag ship 'Fire Demon' are destroyed by the combined efforts of Rikimaru and Ayame, as well as naval elements of the Gohda army.",2000-08-15 00:00:00.000,14,NULL,NULL,NULL,82.4546,46

128519,80821,The Mummy,"Ardeth Bay addresses the player directly, saying that they have released an ancient evil fear for three millennia. The player then takes over as Rick O'Connell, who is situated in the catacombs of Hamunaptra and begins making his way through the tunnels, killing off thieves and taking any artifacts he can find. O’Connell then operates the opening mechanisms for the tunnel doors, wherein he finds more artifacts and more thieves to be defeated, with a new menace coming in the form of scarabs, which are burned away with the torch that O’Connell must light. Going further into the catacombs, O’Connell states that he has a bad feeling and makes his way into a pit, at which point a dried, raspy inhuman voice shouts in ancient Egyptian and mummies erupt from the ground, which are more challenging to kill than the thieves. After dispatching the mummies and escaping the pit, O’Connell goes in further to find more undead minions, these dressed in blue and gold trimmings and prove harder to kill than the mummies, requiring three strikes of the sword. These are defeated, however, and O’Connell encounters more grave robbers before going further into the catacombs, finding a room filled with some treasure pieces which are taken, before moving on to reach another corridor filled with mummies. In time, O’Connell reaches a sarcophagus that is opened, revealing a sword that shines blue. O’Connell then leaves the chamber.",2000-11-17 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,66.4629,5

187244,1,Thief II: The Metal Age,"The game begins as Garrett continues his life as a thief. However, he is betrayed by his fence and ambushed after an early mission, and he determines that Truart, the local sheriff, is hunting him. Keepers take Garrett to hear a prophecy about the ""Metal Age"", which he ignores. As Garrett leaves, one of the Keepers informs him that Truart had been hired to kill him, and he gives Garrett a letter that directs him to eavesdrop on a Mechanist meeting. There, Garrett overhears Truart and Father Karras discussing the conversion of street people into mindless ""Servants"", who wear masks that emit a red vapor capable of reducing themselves and nearby humans to rust. Truart promises to provide Karras with twenty victims for the Servant project, not realizing that Karras is recording his words for use in blackmail. Garrett steals the recording from a safe deposit box, in order to coerce Truart into revealing his employer. 
 
However, Garrett finds Truart murdered at his estate. Evidence at the crime scene leads him to spy on the police officer Lt. Mosley. Garrett sees Mosley deliver a suspicious letter, which is carried through a portal by a wounded pagan. Garrett enters the portal and finds himself outside the City, and he follows the pagan's trail of blood to Viktoria, who persuades Garrett to join her against the Mechanists. On a lead from Viktoria, he infiltrates Karras' office to learn about the ""Cetus Project"",[31] and inadvertently discovers that Karras is giving Servants to the City's nobles. Garrett travels to a Mechanist base to find out more about the Cetus Project, which is revealed to be a submarine. In order to locate and kidnap a high-ranking Mechanist named Brother Cavador, Garrett stows away in the vehicle. 
 
After delivering Cavador to Viktoria, Garrett steals a Servant mask to learn about a Mechanist technology called a ""Cultivator"". Meanwhile, Karras hides inside the Mechanist cathedral in preparation for his plan. Garrett and Viktoria learn that it is the Cultivators inside Servant masks which emit red vapor, or ""rust gas"". Karras had provided Servants to nobles with gardens in order to set off an apocalyptic chain reaction. Viktoria plans to lure the Servants into the hermetically sealed Mechanist cathedral before Karras activates their masks, but Garrett believes this to be too dangerous and leaves. Viktoria goes to the cathedral alone and dies while filling it with plants, and Garrett completes her plan, killing Karras in the rust gas. Afterward, Garrett is approached by a Keeper who explains that Karras' scheme and Viktoria's death had been prophesied. Garrett demands to know the rest of the Keepers' prophecies as the game ends.",2000-03-21 00:00:00.000,51,NULL,90.0000,1,87.3998,114

154375,106678,Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: The Scar of the Sky,"The main character is a young man named Chen Jingchou (陳靖仇, meaning ""To pacify the northern foes and to avenge Chen.""), the only royal descendant remaining from the decimated Chen Dynasty. The final attempt for counterattack from the Chen family happened several years before Chen Jingchou was born, when the tens-of-thousands-strong remnants of Chen forces were single-handedly wiped out by a 10-year-old Sui child, Yang Tuo (楊拓) (later known as Yuwen Tuo 宇文拓), a student of Yang Su. 
 
Having lived under the reign of those who destroyed his kingdom, Chen Jingchou had been educated by his mentor, Chen Fu (陳輔), to pursue a life of vengeance and of reviving his kingdom. The first step of their journey to restore Chen was to acquire the Mirror of Kunlun, one of the Ten Great Ancient Artifacts.[2] 
 
The ancient monstrosity Taotie was released from a mirror that was revealed to be a fake. In order to protect Jingchou, Fu trapped himself with Taotie using a potent Silk of Ice spell, and instructed Jingchou to embark at once to find a way to save him, as well as finding information concerning other Artifacts. As he set out on his journey, Jingchou summoned an elemental spirit familiar given to him by his master to accompany him on his journeys. 
 
Jingchou later was later joined by Yu Xiaoxue (于小雪), a white haired girl showing unusual healing magic potential, the honorable half Göktürks-blooded hero Zhang Lie (張烈)[3] and Zhang's young sister-in-law Tuoba Yu'er (拓拔玉兒) of the Tuoba tribe, which kept the Shennong Ding for generations and was subject to indiscriminate slaughter by the Sui emperor's troops. During their expedition in collecting the Artifacts, they encountered several Blood Rituals of Ten Thousand Souls, rites conducted by Grand Preceptor Yuwen Tuo which involved the killing of ten thousand souls to gather their essences into a single Blood Pearl. The party attempted to intervene with the rituals, but Yuwen Tuo proved to be too formidable a foe. Thus they adopted the strategy of subterfuge, hampering his every effort to collect the Blood Pearls without direct confrontations, and was even helped in secret by a young princess named Dugu Ningke (獨孤寧珂), who held tremendous political power due to her relation with her uncle, the emperor, and protested Yuwen's actions. 
 
Eventually, their plan failed, and Yu Xiaoxue was held as a hostage by Tuo in exchange for the Artifacts that Jingchou's party had collected, namely the Shennong Ding, the Seal of Kongtong, the Pangu Axe, the Nüwa Stone, and the Kunlun Mirror. Jingchou complied, yet Tuo discarded the Stone and the mirror as fakes, proclaiming that he himself was actually the human avatar of the Kunlun Mirror. Surprisingly, Yu Xiaoxue refused to leave with Jingchou, stating that she intended to stay and help Tuo's project, and seemingly betrays his trust by repelling his attack on Yuwen's plans wielding the Xuan-Yuan Sword. Losing all hope, Jingchou gave up his quest and opted to travel with his similarly disheartened mentor. 
 
Ningke, who was actually a demon general dispatched from the western pantheon of Hell, was displeased with this turn of events. She infiltrated China by possessing the original Princess Dugu who died of illness, and arrived in anticipation of what was calculated to be the time a comet named Crimson Piercer (Chi Guan - 赤貫) would pass through the sky, opening a rift in the divine protective barrier of the Chinese lands and allowing an opportunity for demons from the West to invade. Tuo learned of the implications of the passage of the comet, and set out to collect five of the Artifacts in order to seal the rift the comet would cause in the Barrier of the Ninth Heaven in the firmament above Shenzhou. However, several of the five Artifacts required for the Ritual of Mending were nowhere to be found. Ningke proposed that he substitute these with Blood Pearls along with the construction of a Tower of Babel, and a Pentagram ritual formation. In order to save the Chinese world, using his power, his riches and his relation with the Emperor Yang, Tuo managed to accomplish these despite his moral misgivings. In the process, Tuo also discovered that Xiaoxue was actually the avatar of the Stone of Nüwa, as Artifacts resonate with each other when in close proximity. Consequently, he told her of his plan and convinced her to help him, leading to misunderstandings between her and Jingchou. 
 
Ningke could not allow the Ritual to be abandoned and manipulated Jingchou through treachery by murdering Yu'er, who learned the truth behind the situation after going to the Grand Preceptor Residence in secret in an attempt to reconcile Xiaoxue and Jingchou, and framing Xiaoxue and Tuo. Fueled by anger and grief, Jingchou's party managed to reach the top of the Tower of Babel, where they were beaten once again by Tuo. Ningke suddenly appeared in the confusion and seized Xiaoxue as hostage to divert Tuo's attention. Jingchou took the opportunity and severed Tuo's arm. Ningke then revealed her true demon form, imprisoning Tuo with magic. Unable to mend the sky, the Chinese world fell under Satan's rule of death and destruction. 
 
Days later, under the instruction of the now immortal He Ran and Gu Yuesheng (last seen in Xuan-Yuan Sword 2), Jingchou's group, which now also includes a young Li Shimin successfully retrieved the Artifacts from Ningke's handmaidens in the bloodied world, and returned to the Tower. They defeated Ningke with her full unrestricted power, and rescued Tuo. Having the Artifacts at hand, Jingchou and company invoked the Ritual of Reversal (which is also named the Ritual of Loss, 失卻之陣) at the top of Tower of Babel, which, utilizing the power of Tuo as the avatar the Mirror of Kunlun at the ritual formation's center, reversed time and brought the party back to the moment prior to the passing of Chi Guan. 
 
The group invoked the Ritual of Trespass (also called the Ritual of Babel), sending them above the sky, and arrived at Chi Guan itself. Coming across the Heavenly Maiden White Jade Ring (天女白玉輪), an eight trigrams formation used by the deities Fuxi and Nüwa to revive their deceased daughter in ancient times, Jingchou had the choice to bring Yu'er back to life at the cost of expending a great deal of Xiaoxue's power. At the heart of the meteor, where the party prepared to cast the Ritual of Sealing, which caused the non-artifact casters to lose their most precious memories or ideals (with Zhang Lie losing his ambition of unifying the lands, Li Shimin losing his love for his family, and Jingchou losing his memories of Yu'er or his master depending on the ending), Ningke, then still alive and ignorant of the recent events Jingchou and his companions experienced, appeared and attempted to continue her deception, but a fight ensued, and Ningke was vanquished. The party decided to grant her final wishes: to be returned to her homeland, and to become free to love whom she loves. Gu stated that was impossible due to her demonic nature, and placed her soul into the Fuxi Qin (伏羲琴), which Yuwen Tuo brought with him on his self-imposed exile to the west, Ningke's homeland, after the events of the game for her soul to be cleansed eventually. 
 
Chen Fu witnessed what appeared to be Jingchou assisting in the machinations of Yuwen Tuo, their sworn enemy. Ningke exploited this before heading to Chi Guan by giving Chen Fu the Fruit of Satan, a demonic object that grants power in exchange for sanity, deceiving him into battling against his student. Chen Fu soon arrived at the heart of Chi Guan with the intent to destroy it. Jingchou's group was left with no choice but to kill Chen Fu to save the world.",2000-12-02 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
